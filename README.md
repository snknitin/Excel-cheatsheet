* Selecting the cell and dragging the small square at the bottom right corner will help autofill the pattern. Even works for names of months and weeks
* Anytime you make a formula it will make **relative references** if you copy and paste that cell. Relative to where that formula is, it will operate on those corresponding cells. This works if all the terms are in the same column and you copy the function to different columns.
* Use **$** to make an **absolute refernce** to a particular cell tat may not be part of the column you are operating on
* Reference a range using **:**, for example G4:G8 for a column and G4:L8 to reference a matrix selection
